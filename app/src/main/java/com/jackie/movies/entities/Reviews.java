     * 2016 has not been very kind to DC Comics-based personalities looking to shine consistently
     * like their big screen Marvel Comics counterparts. Following the super-sized dud that was
     * _Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice_ released a few months ago must really put some major
     * pressure on Warner Bros. to gamble on ensuring that the presence of **Suicide Squad** does
     * not meet the same kind of indifferent reception. Well, it turns out that although the
     * anticipation was high for writer-director David Ayer's supervillain saga involving
     * high-powered imprisoned rogues recruited as U.S. governmental operatives out to stop other
     * skillful baddies (as it was for Zack Ryder's aforementioned \"Dawn of Justice\") the
     * concoction of **Suicide Squad** feels like a colorful mishmash of collective misfits
     * laboriously taking up space in a disjointed eye candy-coated spectacle that never manages
     * to match its intended sizzle.\r\n\r\nOne would think that the premise for **Suicide
     * Squad** would tap into the intriguing naughtiness with more robust gumption given the
     * collection of super-powered oddballs asked to be immediate anti-heroes in this toothless
     * jamboree of renegade rejects. Strangely, the grim and brooding presentation of **Suicide
     * Squad** is more of an erratic downer than a hyperactive high-wire act as intended at the
     * creative hands of Ayer. There is no reason why this lively group of adventurous agitators
     * should appear so flat and inconsequential in a boisterous blockbuster that sporadically
     * limps.\r\n\r\nGiven the twisted members that comprise this elite team of terrorizing tools
     * it is very disappointing to see how **Suicide Squad** struggles with its so-called
     * subversive themes. Sadly, this splattered mess never firmly grasps its bid for distinctive
     * irreverence or off-balance exploitation. Instead, **Squad** feels strained in its
     * execution and we are never really invested in entirely watching these treasured
     * troublemakers find redemption because the story is soggy and uninspired. Furthermore, not
     * all of the **Squad** participants are fleshed out satisfyingly for us to get behind with
     * thirsty cynicism. The headlining leads in Will Smith's Floyd Lawton/Deadshot, Oscar-winner
     * Jared Leto's green-haired Joker and Australian beauty Margot Robbie's Harleen
     * Quinzel/Harley Quinn get the meaty standout parts while the lesser known supporting cast
     * get stuck with chewing on the thankless remaining bone while seemingly acting as
     * background furniture to the bigger names.\r\n\r\nNaturally, desperation has set in for the
     * U.S. government as they need to safeguard national security against advanced sinister
     * forces that threaten the fiber of American self-interests everywhere. What better way to
     * hire gifted protection than to consider employing the world's most incarcerated
     * corruptible, cutthroat cretins to perform the dirty work in unforgivable mission ops that
     * require death-defying determination. Enter U.S. Intelligence agent Amanda Waller (Oscar
     * nominee Viola Davis). Waller's duties are to assemble the ragtag team known as the Suicide
     * Squad--ominous (yet talented) jailbirds tapped to step in and assume superhero status
     * (especially when the real superheroes are tied up in other crime-stopping affairs) while
     * helping out for the greater good of our vulnerable society. In exchange for the Suicide
     * Squad's sacrifice in turning from hell-bent heels to reluctant heralded heroes they are
     * promised commuted prison sentences should they effectively defend and destroy the deadly
     * foes out to promote heavy-handed havoc across the board.\r\n\r\nConveniently, bureaucratic
     * bigwig Waller (through voiceover) introduces the Suicide Squad and describes what
     * beneficial assets they bring to the turbulent table. Among the naughty notables include
     * the well-known ace sniper Floyd Lawton/Deadshot as well as legendary lethal joy-boy Joker
     * and his better (or perhaps worst half) in girlfriend Harley Quinn. The other toxic
     * tag-a-longs along for the thrill ride of becoming rebellious rescuers include George
     * Harkness/Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Chato Santana/El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Waylon
     * Jones/Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Tatsu Yamashiro/Katana, Enchantress (Cara
     * Delevingne) and Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman).\r\n\r\nOverall, **Suicide Squad** is
     * surprisingly depressing and goes through the proverbial motions without so much as taking
     * advantage of its surrealistic makeup. The movie never realizes its excitable potential and
     * drifts into yet another superhero yarn that is more patchy than pronounced. Smith's
     * Deadshot is out in the forefront but for the most part feels restrained and not as spry
     * and savvy as one would imagine. Leto's Joker obviously pales in comparison to the
     * brilliant and mesmerizing psychotic take on the role that earned the late Heath Ledger his
     * posthumous Oscar statuette. In all fairness, nobody could inhabit the Clown Prince of
     * Crime as Ledger uncannily did with committed concentration. Still, Leto's Joker--although
     * viciously off-balance--felt recycled and furiously empty at times. Robbie's turn as
     * Joker's misguided main squeeze merely comes off as a bratty Barbie Doll with synthetic
     * edginess. The other **Squad** participants settle for the back burner more or less which
     * is a crying shame because they should have been more engaged than the tepid material
     * allowed them to be initially.\r\n\r\nWoefully sketchy and missing the fueled opulence that
     * one would expect emerging from this cockeyed costume caper **Suicide Squad** is a
     * detonating dud for the missing explosive DC Comics movie brand that needs to step up the
     * pace if they expect to make a consistent and challenging impression on the devoted fanboys
     * at the box office looking to move beyond the sardonic fantasy-based realm of another
     * redundant serving of a _Batman/Superman_ entry.\r\n\r\n**Suicide Squad** (2016)
